# plushu-version

This plugin provides the `version` command / option that describes the
currently installed version of the Plushu core.

This plugin determines Plushu's version based on the Git revision that is
currently checked out, so it will not work if PLUSHU_ROOT does not contain a
`.git` GIT_DIR.
